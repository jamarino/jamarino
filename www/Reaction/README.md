# Diffusion Reaction Simulation

This project simulates diffusion reactions using WebGL 2. It provides a visual representation of how substances diffuse and react over time.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser that supports WebGL 2.
3. Ensure that your browser has WebGL enabled.

## Overview of the Simulation

The simulation visualizes the diffusion of substances in a 2D space. It uses WebGL 2 for rendering, allowing for efficient graphics processing. The main components of the simulation include:

- **Initialization**: Setting up the WebGL context and preparing the canvas.
- **Buffers and Textures**: Creating and managing the necessary buffers and textures for rendering the simulation.
- **Animation Loop**: Continuously updating the simulation state and rendering the results to the canvas.

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different parameters to see how they affect the diffusion process!
